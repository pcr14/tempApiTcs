1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,280
All right, so we have printed two lists, and now if you carefully observe in this list, they don't

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,180
index first index.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,290
So there is a mapping, first index of them is a second index of some is rejected.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,940
So there is a mapping here, right.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,780
So that's how these are there.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:26,890
Now, let's write one logic that we will first find out which index is present in this names list,

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,480
OK?

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,810
And on that index, let's go to stats and see if it is approved or rejected because there is one to

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,390
one mapping.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:43,960
So if you see the two list and compare with your CSP name status, one, two, one mapping is there

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,410
for two.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,590
List them abroad, some rejected.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,130
Right.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,210
So the name and the status will come in the same index for that particular group.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,890
OK, so don't.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,440
So now to understand if some case is rejected or not, first we will try to see in which your next exam

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,320
is present in this names list.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,830
OK, how do you do that?

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:14,680
So if you want to know the index of any item in your list, there is a method called list, which is

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,060
names here, DOT Index.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,740
OK, so it will give the index of your element name.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,700
So here you want to know the index of the same.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,390
Right, and you can store it in one variable.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,650
Right.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,440
So this will give you the zero one two second right and address one to one mapping.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,790
If you can grab the second index of stats, that will be nothing but status of this loan.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,820
So zero one two, that means the same thing, right?

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,420
Sam is right.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,550
So we are smartly capturing that into two different lists and then using the index.

30
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,350
We are trying to figure out that now.

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,000
So once you understood that.

32
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:08,290
I'm coming on one index now on this list, stats, stats just give that index number because this holds

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,450
about status, loan status of the same loan status to.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,180
Brent.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,650
Sam Malone status is.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,120
Give this very long status.

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,570
OK, so let's give capital letters.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,680
Just to follow coding standards, OK, now if you run this, then it will give you a perfectly Sam Malone

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,920
status is rejected, right?

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,360
Similarly, if you want to know the status and just give that down here.

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,780
Let's keep in genetic.

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,250
Launch status is rejected for as well.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
You see that Joe is rejected.

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,220
So like this, you can build a logic and you can read CSFI file and then extract the values so you can

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,740
play around like this with The Cafferty File getting into last night right into it and push them into

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,870
one more list with the index.

47
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,110
OK, it's up to your imagination again.

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,020
How do you want to play?

49
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,810
But this is how you can read the values in CSFI.

50
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,790
OK, in the next lecture I will show how to write the values to CSC.

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,500
All right.

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,380
Thank you.
