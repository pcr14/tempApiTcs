1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,570
All right, so if you don't want to write this in multiple lines, you can all just write it in one

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,160
single line.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,520
So once you know this is dictionary and study, once you know this is a list and why do we need to store

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,550
it in separate variable and call zero index?

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,350
You can call it directly zero zero and that's it.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,020
You can get rid of all these steps.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,640
Isn't it also the same output?

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,640
OK, so let me write it in the bottom and show you you can skip all these lengths.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,690
I'm commenting it out.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,810
So.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,020
If I simply call this, this will return the list and in the list I want zero index.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,670
So once you get familiarized with all the data types, then you can directly use like this.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,580
But if you are confused, then step by step, how I have done in my previous lecture, take into one

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,170
variable and finally decoded.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:04,450
You see that it's still OK now this is one design, but in most of times you will not have this design

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:04,900
like this.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,580
You will have this in the file.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,090
OK, so now what I am doing, I have my design file here.

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,510
I copied the content in my design firm and stored it as a string in one variable rate.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,420
This is one approach of passing.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,780
What if you have this in file with you externally in your system and Python should automatically open

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,420
you file, extract the content out of it and then pass it?

23
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,730
OK, so that would be also one of the scenario, right?

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,420
Most of them will have a face and it might not be ideal to copy here every day.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,310
It's it's referred, but it's the government that when you have a smaller design with this static.

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,940
So now to extract files and pass it, there is another method in Python so far that I would go back

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,180
to one of my days and file.

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,320
Yeah, so this is the DNA file and this is a little complex.

29
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,620
And I learned first of all, copy this into the DNA, a for clear visibility.

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:15,000
All right, so this is the distance and you see that key Mustafah, let's see, what are the keys?

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,180
Oh, there are only two keys.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,820
Technically, when you convert that's in the dictionary because that's where we can do it.

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,100
Right, using method.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,250
And ideally, you have only two keys and the value of our stickies, again, dignity by seeing this

35
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,610
Kalume.

36
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,310
This, as you can understand that there is one more dictionary, but value of this courses squared bracket,

37
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,180
that means the list.

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,760
OK, so like this step by step, you can be good, you can minimize it and understand what's happening

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,300
inside it.

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,480
OK, all right.

41
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:54,040
So I have this in external file location, Goldstar Jason and this is my Pottsy users on our document.

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,200
So I click I can copy the part from here.

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,870
Full file to clipboard.

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,260
Good.

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,170
So I will go back to my editor.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,170
And this time our goal is to open the file and then pass it.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,470
We don't want to deliberately mention everything here.

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:29,720
Bus content present in decent flight to remember the difference in the previously with part of the content

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,240
present in decent strength and now five.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,220
First of all, you have to open that file, right?

51
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,560
So basically Baynton has to open the file and read the content.

52
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,310
So as we discussed in our previous sections, so that's what I say.

53
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,600
I always refer to watch my python basics, because if you skip those section videos, then you may not

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,110
be understanding what I am talking now because I already took some good amount of time to understand

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,330
those.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,650
So there is one lecture I explained how to read and write files using Python.

57
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,940
OK, we are going to use the same concept here.

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:13,240
So our first goal is to open the file and read so far that there is a very important you can open the

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,710
file with this method open and you have to give the part of your file.

60
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,910
Right, soccer star, Jason, so you can give the courts.

61
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:39,140
So this is the part where my desk and files do it and I want to open this so I have an open method as

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,510
let's give any object if.

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,660
Five.

64
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:54,830
Now, so this F object have the ability to read your and file because you have opened it and read more.

65
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,100
So if you don't mention any parameter by default, this will open and read more.

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,090
If you want to write it, you have to give it another parameter called WQ, which we will see in our

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,720
next letters.

68
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:12,710
OK, so next step, Jason Dot, you see that there are two methods available here.

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,570
Lourdes is what we have seen in our previous letter.

70
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,550
Lourdes will take a string as an argument.

71
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,080
But in our case this time, we don't have this string.

72
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,570
We have file object.

73
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,290
OK, so our final object then is another method in Python to use, which is the Lord Lord.

74
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:39,430
And you have to simply pass your file object because this object have permission to open you up a decent

75
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,760
file.

76
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:47,730
OK, so then it will open and Lord Method will read all the content accessed by this object.

77
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,220
So you will again get all over this file content now in the dictionary.

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,610
So I'm just storing that into another variable.

79
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:05,020
OK, so this data available is nothing but dictionary again, just like how you have started into one

80
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,650
variable here.

81
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,210
Also we are studying in data.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,840
Right now, once you get that into the dictionary, let's bring this just to make sure you get a dictionary

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,470
back or not, and I would also print tape so that you will know the written type.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,180
What you have is a dictionary.

85
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,990
So control shift, if then you can just right click and sarandos this and passing anything is fine.

86
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,950
You see that last two lines.

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
This is dictionary and everything you have here.

88
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,660
In this study for the same reason, but now you can access with your dictionary methods.

89
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,790
OK, now let's go back to our ED.

90
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,320
As I told you, I'll treat it as a dictionary.

91
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,020
So now your goal is to print.

92
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,530
The second course course.

93
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,590
OK, so this is the real question.

94
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:07,340
I have given you the system and I have asked you to bring a second class of at the academy.

95
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,730
What is the second class?

96
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,330
So basically, if you scroll down, these are the courses in the design file.

97
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,740
And this is the first class, right?

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,130
Yeah, this is the first class and this is a second class.

99
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,130
So you have to print Cyprus in your output.

100
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,750
And the next requirement is that you have to print a website now, which is set up, which would be

101
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,500
a miracle.

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,560
OK, so these two you have to do now, let's pass them carefully.

103
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,750
Now, first, we have to get second class status, right?

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,050
So minimize them to understand the hierarchy.

105
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,160
So basically when you minimize them.

106
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,010
First of all, this is a dictionary, however, and there are two items.

107
00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:01,140
So my actual title is present in this crate, so I will start from basic first at data to access the

108
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,400
value of key.

109
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:09,540
I can use courses because this is the key which will help you to access like.

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,460
So now if I print this, it will print all the.

111
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,020
Three.

112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,760
Complete list.

113
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,890
Basically, this is the list.

114
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,340
OK, so this dictionary is holding the list.

115
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,590
Right now, let's spread this.

116
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,750
OK, so this is how it retained me.

117
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,730
So basically it retains the value of this courses, which is nothing but list.

118
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:45,950
So once you understand this is the list and in the list there are three items or square bracket.

119
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,800
And this is the first item and this is the second item of the list and this is the third item of the

120
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,070
list.

121
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,280
But interesting thing here is first item in the list is what is that string?

122
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,910
No, if you see on my previous example, this is also a list like this is on the list, but items in

123
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,150
the list are simple strings here.

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,020
So you will just access the width of the zero index otherwise written.

125
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,920
But here in my zeroth index, it's not string.

126
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,470
There is one more dictionary present in the list.

127
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,460
Well, this is complicated, but that's fine.

128
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,270
Right?

129
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,450
So in the zeroth item, one dictionary is present in the first item and other dictionaries present.

130
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,170
So our goal is to print the second item.

131
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,670
So that means the next in the first index, because index I start from zero.

132
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:45,410
OK, so that means in this dictionary we have to as a list, we have to access first item so that we

133
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,670
can will come here so it successfully access to this.

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,960
OK, now when you print this, it will just return the second item, which is a dictionary.

135
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,070
So dictionary will be one output now because you are accessing the second element.

136
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,220
Let's see.

137
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,140
You see that perfectly dictionary is written.

138
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,490
OK, now let's create this other dictionary and this dictionary.

139
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,650
If you want to get title, how would you access it?

140
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,110
So initially, this is dictionary like data.

141
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,260
And if you want to access the key data, of course, a civil right now, in our case, this whole is

142
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,810
a dictionary.

143
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,710
And if you want to access a lot of it, you can simply say them and that's it.

144
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,910
And we understand this will return.

145
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,600
OK, so that's how step by step you have to proceed.

146
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:44,600
So once you see the Decem, you have to scan in your mind about what all these like what is the last

147
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,930
what is a dictionary and then start passing from the base.

148
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,240
And it would be easy for you to pass any Jason right now.

149
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,160
This is very complex.

150
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,300
Some days you'll see that there are mysteries inside it, but they have simply passed it and extracted

151
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,090
the whatever item you want with the concept of list and andexanet is OK.

152
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,750
And next, our next goal is to access this website.

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,100
OK, so how do you access the academic outcome again?

154
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,350
Now minimize everything.

155
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:24,090
Let's start from the basics again and our website details are present inside of this Plastiki item of

156
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,600
big study.

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:24,790
Right.

158
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,960
So this is the parent, the extended data support data.

159
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
This time you have to go inside dashboard.

160
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,980
So dashboard awesome.

161
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,650
And here where you can access the item.

162
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,520
So when you do this, then you will get the output.

163
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,310
What do you get the output, so output also here is the dictionary, OK, so key is that dashboard and

164
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,560
value this time is returning one more extended.

165
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,460
This is not list.

166
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,900
You see that calibrations are there.

167
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,490
Right?

168
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:04,090
So output is also on because they can form print dictionary and you can also print the type of this.

169
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,390
So.

170
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,610
You will now understand that our put.

171
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,070
OK, so you see that in the dictionary and this is what you present.

172
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,240
So in my dictionary, if I want to access website key value, it's simple, you know.

173
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,560
Right.

174
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,810
You just need to access the key website.

175
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
So given column.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,070
Svetlana Binsted.

177
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,150
Right, so inside this loops what happened.

178
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
Oh, that's right.

179
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,970
So let me complete website.

180
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,080
So now when you bring this, bring our Web site me.

181
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,900
So that Travelocity Economy.com.

182
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,560
So this is how you can access any and it meant you knew about this.

183
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,780
And so the difference between the previous example and this is in previous example, we have used a

184
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,100
string and here we have a file and we have successfully done that.

185
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:14,120
And that's how you can pick any complex and whatever you have and use the concepts.

186
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,350
What I have told in these two lectures, and you can just do it on the fly.

187
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,240
All right.

188
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,270
So that's pretty much a worthless lecture.

189
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,520
Guys, thank you.
