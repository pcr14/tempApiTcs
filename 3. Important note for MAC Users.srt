00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,200
All right, so this video is for Mac users to give a quick update that you need not set any by on part

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,150
or part in your system variables.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:23,530
If you are working in Mac OS, when you install Python in your system, automatically, Mac will set

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,480
that in your part variable.

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:32,830
OK, so after you install Python successfully, just click on whatever it prompts, then it will tell

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:41,710
that Python is successfully installed there after you just need to type which python to let me maximize.

7
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,410
Right, you can see that it got in stark slash user slash been slashed.

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,620
So you already have by in your path without doing anything.

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,630
But do remember that you should have only one version of Python that is three plus anything after three.

10
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,460
If you have older version, which is less than three, then you need to be a little cautious because

11
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,210
if you have multiple versions of Python, you'll never know which was enough Python, your system is

12
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,230
being pointed to.

13
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:30,000
OK, so in that case, if you still have any older version, then which Python three, because the version

14
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,230
what you have downloaded is a greater than three, however.

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,620
So in my system, I just want to show you that I do also have previous version to that seven.

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,390
So that's the reason to know which version I have in my system.

17
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:53,260
I have added a word three so that Python triggered in start here, use the local bin.

18
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,360
So if you have only one version of Python, you really need not worry about that.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,800
Number three, just like how we have seen in our previous video on Windows.

20
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,740
But if you think that if you have any older versions, then to know which version you have, just add

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,790
to this or that, it will show where exactly that is located.

22
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:19,330
But if you are still interested to know where exactly this python guard stored in your system.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,050
This is the part, OK, go to library frameworks and here where you will see open the terminal.

24
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,780
Let's open the tunnel very quick.

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,970
And so to go to that part, I can simply say open.

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,100
Slash celebrity, let's go to that patency, and that will take you to this spot from here, library

27
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:52,870
frameworks, frameworks by standard framework versions and here where you will see the version, what

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,900
you got downloaded.

29
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,380
So this is exact part where exactly your python gets stored.

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,190
But you might be wondered that if this is the part why I am seeing here local been.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,000
So basically we need executable files to set it in our system variables.

32
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:22,390
So automatically come all this bin folder is copied into this user user local folder.

33
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:30,100
We'll get this complete folder of executable files which are required to run Python are automatically

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,270
copied to the spot and your Mac mission will listen to this part by default.

35
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,590
OK, so that's the reason you need not write anything.

36
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,410
So if you still see any issues that Python is not being recognized, please let me know.

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,380
Post a question in the discussion board related to my configuration and I will help you.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Overall, I just want to tell you that you need not do anything.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,780
And if you really need to know Python is stored, this is the location.

40
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,900
All right.

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,180
That's all I have.

42
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,900
Thank you.
