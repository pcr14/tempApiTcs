1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,870
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,670
So let's go to our agenda and see what we have accomplished a lot so we know what our future definition

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,400
files and behave.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:18,130
We also created we really structured in our project so we can return existing EPA test also in military

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,520
style.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,030
We also understood the importance of context available.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,460
Right.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,640
And the next one is to see how to achieve data driven and how to do parameterization of your test with

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,870
multiple datasets.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,340
This is interesting.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,840
Now, so if you see this step, you are actually hard coating the data here.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,290
OK, every time we are coming and changing the data, you need not change because you are cleaning the

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,120
data at the end.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,300
So that should be fine.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,920
But what if you want to run any EPA test with multiple data sets?

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,250
OK, so that it could be a scenario that you want to repeat during a test with different data sets every

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,530
time.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Let's see that.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,190
How to do.

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:10,410
OK, so in our case, let's assume that we want to run over a big test with different Aspendale combinations

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:10,980
every time.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,960
OK, so let's do one thing.

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:22,110
We will add I'll also and put it here so that this method now will accept two parameters.

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:31,010
I spin and I'll let slide one which find from that file we will make sure this feature file ran with

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,390
a different data sets each time it has to pick one ISBN and I'll combination.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,310
OK, let's see how to do that.

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:45,060
Before that, let me give some numbers here because we just changed that method signature so that it

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,440
also will be now sent as part of your method.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,900
Great.

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,050
So if you want to add to parameterization, then here you have to.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,690
Give me a second.

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,960
Yeah, so you have to use another key word here instead of scenario use scenario outlined.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,430
So this is the key word you want to use if you want to parametrized who are testing multiple datasets.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
OK, so select this.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,970
And it will show an error, so if you more about cancer, then it will create examples s. what is this?

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,370
So let's see that before that, let me do one thing.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,010
I'll copy paste the same scenario.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,910
I'm done.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,160
Make sure you go back one step, because when you got a scenario, it should be here.

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,340
This should not mix with this.

41
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,650
Right.

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,960
But I want to repeat this test with multiple data sets.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,180
Right.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,210
So I will add a scenario outlined.

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,480
And when you add this, it will complain to an example section.

46
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,630
So let's create that.

47
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,830
So what is this so here where you can send your combinations, so I just thought that let's run this

48
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:12,550
just with ESPN and I'll combination so you can send those values here instead of hard coding in your

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,670
test methods.

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,420
So now we are sending these values by hard calling it from here.

51
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,720
Right.

52
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's change that.

53
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,500
Let's bring these values from our feet.

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,460
And finally, because this is the best practice the values data should be in your scenario so that,

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,000
you know, you want to be a business analyst, product developer.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,360
Anyone can come and give the data here because they don't want to really care about what exactly is

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,700
doing.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,660
Let's say you are a business analyst, knows the data, so you can just share this copy and she can

59
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,200
read it because it's plain English so she can read it at ESPN and Elle values for you.

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,000
But if you read somewhere like this here, she can understand where exactly she has to act because this

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,530
is a technical write.

62
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,770
OK, so let's add those values here.

63
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,320
It's very simple, guys are just like smart people have you create Excel.

64
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,620
So under this ISBN value will go.

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,970
Let me give some random spin and as a gift pipe symbol so that it separates from ESPN.

66
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,600
Give any I lember.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,940
And that's say this is one combination.

68
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:28,170
Now, if you want to run this dust scenario with the another combination, then add another.

69
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:37,780
OK, so another data sets and this is a new data set and you can give new and perfect the see.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,560
So you have two data sets now.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,090
So this test will run two different times each time.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,210
It will run with one row.

73
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,750
OK, so with the first row, it will run the list and again, it will end with this test.

74
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,930
But no actual problem here is how these values will now come into this method.

75
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,530
OK, so let's not hardcourt now.

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,820
Let's load this in this way.

77
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,800
Our values should come and fall here, which is a tricky.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,930
OK, let's see.

79
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:21,620
I will go back to feature file again, so the changes, what you have to do here instead of giving this

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,390
plane line.

81
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,970
Let's modify this line like this, given the details with ISBN.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,470
And I OK.

83
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,070
Make sure you write the same keyword, what you see here.

84
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:46,990
Exactly here and put them between arrows, if you do like this, then behave, treat this as a barometer.

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,220
Right.

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,460
And now when you run the scenario, given the details with these two, Aspendale, I'll write whenever

87
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,980
it sees Arrow, then it will immediately come to the role, what it is executing, and it will try to

88
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,360
match once a match found, it will take that value and place it here.

89
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,720
Similarly, when it's IAL because it is in arrows, it will again search in the same room and when the

90
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,420
rule matches, it will take this number and place it here.

91
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,130
So this way from here you can send these values to your definition and write the logic there.

92
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,640
OK, so right now we don't have the same definition implementation for this because this is a new method

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,450
which we just did.

94
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:28,700
Right.

95
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,170
So let's add that I'll come to some definition.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
Let's not disturb this.

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,110
For that, I will create another given.

98
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,910
Given.

99
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,860
Yeah, the book details right here, you have two cats with curly braces, so the value want to have

100
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,140
provided they're ISBN will just come and sit in this cuddly bracers value here, right?

101
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,720
Let me show you let's try it amateur here so you can use a the same def.

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:15,600
Step, Bill, you can you see same name doesn't matter only thing which is here is this one.

103
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,580
So fast parameter should be context by default, because context value is past now two values you have

104
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,080
to give here.

105
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,800
One is Isbin and aisle, because this line is sending you two parameters to your meter.

106
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,590
Right.

107
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,940
So these two parameters are coming from your feature file because supertitles like this, this will

108
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,940
feed with these two values.

109
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,810
So once these are freed it now, those two values will come here and from here.

110
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,600
This will fit into your method in these locations.

111
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,600
I aspinwall exactly same word.

112
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,150
Give it here.

113
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,530
So the value, what it comes from feature will come here and you can use all this inside now.

114
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,380
So you have a combination of SBN and I'll with you and that's all.

115
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,530
If you have these details, you can just directly reuse this code.

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,920
OK, and instead of this, instead of hard core values, you can send ISBN somewhere else.

117
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:27,150
So this is how you can write a generic script which big the values of Isbin and able to create new book

118
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,210
ideas from your feature file only.

119
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,950
OK, so now if you go back to your future file now the book.

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,100
These two values are constructed from the values of your past, from your future file.

121
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,400
You understand, right, how we connected all this from this add also connected and from it's coming

122
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,080
here from here to here and then here to actual matter.

123
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,580
And once you get into this matter, we are again feeling it in our dictionary object.

124
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,850
And from there we are sending the body.

125
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,170
So this is how everything is connected.

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,710
But we are doing it nicely from frontin with these values.

127
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:14,280
And if you provide another layer like this, the same scenario will repeat a second time so that with

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,880
multiple datasets now your book will be added.

129
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,600
OK, let's do one thing.

130
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,030
Let's run this and see how this goes.

131
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,770
This time it has to run through scenarios.

132
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,910
This is one scenario.

133
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,790
And here with the two rows, two different scenarios with two different datasets total three scenarios

134
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,420
has to them.

135
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,840
After every scenario, we have a condition to go and delete that book.

136
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,410
Right.

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,450
So it looks good.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,410
Is there any changes what we need to do here?

139
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,240
Let's see.

140
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Nothing, these two are common matters, adding the book and book is deleting it can be commonly used

141
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,990
because once you have your all contact details, it will just take the values here.

142
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,360
OK, let me run this time and see how that goes.

143
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,820
OK, execution is going on good, as I told total three scenarios around this time, if you see feature

144
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,180
file.

145
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,810
Because this ran two times with two different data sets, total nine steps for.

146
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,550
Three here, three plus three, six plus three main steps and nothing is fail, and you can see every

147
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,760
time it created a new first time, it's the data which is directly present in their definition and it

148
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,230
is deleted.

149
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,350
And next time you'll see that the device.

150
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:46,660
That is that, yeah, FBI eight four eight nine four, and this is the beginning because the logic of

151
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,550
creating it is a combination of ESPN and I right to see that book is at it and it is deleted.

152
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Similarly, there is another book with the word seven six three is atter and deleted in.

153
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,320
Clean up environment.

154
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:10,070
So this is how you can data drive your test cases with the different data and you can also parametrized

155
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,160
them using examples, keyword and scenario outlaying.

156
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,140
If you don't mention all Glenden parameterization will not happen here.

157
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,380
You have to make sure that you write this line and give me a number of photos.

158
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:28,770
If you have 100 datasets, you want to run your test, then provide 100 Russia and that's Cucumber's

159
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,670
or behave takes care of running it 100 times.

160
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,460
You'll see that without writing any follow ups are conditions.

161
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,690
We are able to achieve it simply by writing in plain English.

162
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,900
So that's the beauty of reality brainwork.

163
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,810
All right, let's continue the next lecture.

164
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,620
Thank you.
