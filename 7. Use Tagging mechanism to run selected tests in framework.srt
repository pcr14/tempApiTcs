00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,580
All right, so in this lecture, I will show you how to add to tagging mechanism in the frame, but

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,940
let's say there are hundreds of desolating and scenarios and if you want to run only a set of tests

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,240
to get us out of 100.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,070
So how would you differentiate them so you can tag them appropriately and you can tell you what to behave

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,010
to run only those tag the scenarios.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,210
So now, for example, let me tag this with a small test, and this is a regression.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,180
Actually, we have to do this in regulation, we will run with the different data sets, but with smoke

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,260
you will just run one dataset, just assume like this.

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,060
So you'll have hundreds of tests here and filters automatically with smoke.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,900
Field tests are marked with regression so that you'll know when to execute what.

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,610
So if you were scenario is to run only test guesses, which are a mark of as regression.

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,440
So right now there are two, right?

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,760
So if you want to run only test with the smoke or regression, then there's a simple way and be able

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,350
to do that.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,890
To do that.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,660
So you already gave him.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,870
And which futures you want to run, you can give that filenames locks for no capture and then you can

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,860
give banks back sequels too, and you can tell which dog you want to run.

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,540
Let's say I want to run only smokestack.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,280
And now when you run this command, it will execute only Fuster scenario and it will skip the scenario

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,140
which is tied up to this lecci.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
So output this time should be only one scenario past.

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,180
You see that only one scenario passed and two are skipped.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,320
Watch out here.

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,740
Two other scenarios.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,040
Also, we have here regression, right?

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,400
These are two because we are running with two different data sets.

28
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,590
It's clearly telling that I ran only one.

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,650
I skipped two because you asked to run only smoke related tax.

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,010
OK, so similarly, if you want to run only a regression, then you can just mention the only regression

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,740
and this time it will run those two scenarios.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,510
You see two scenarios, only one is skipped, which is the smoke, so if you see the outputted.

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:22,990
Exactly.

34
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,810
And this so this I think is very, very important.

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,430
Guys, in real time, you will have it on at least 50 to 60 death cases.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,430
And it's not that every time you run all the gas cases, let's say you are working in this ajai sprint

37
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,780
of two weeks and the sprint you call a Sprint 15, then you mark those test cases as Sprint 15.

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,130
So whatever test cases you add newly in this sprint, you are Sprint 15.

39
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,220
So before Sprint goes to the list, you want to just check that all the functionalities of the sprint

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,470
are currently working fine.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,530
If not so, you will just go and you can just go and run.

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:06,100
Only those scenarios every day will come blindly here and give that back one sprint 15, that's all.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,250
It will just go and pick up those discuses which are tagged with this sprint 15 and those only will

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,880
get executed.

45
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,560
Restante will be Skemp.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,370
And this is very frequently used in real time automation projects.

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,980
And it's very simple and easy concept.

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,240
Right.

49
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:28,450
You just need to remember how to tag with Aderet and how to give that tag equal to regression here.

50
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,480
Stanning OK, I hope you are clear with this functionality.

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,640
Thank you.
