00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,860
Welcome, guys.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,410
So in this section, we will see what is Web scrapping and how to achieve that in Python using one of

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,510
the famous packets called Beautiful Soap.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,750
OK, so beautiful is not adjective here.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,330
It is the package name.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,980
We call it a beautiful soap, which is available in Python.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,790
Right.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,740
So first, what is Web scrapping?

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's try to understand some basics behind it.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,570
So it's all about extracting the data, all you can say content from any webpage.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:46,320
OK, so in general, people use Web automation frameworks like selenium when they want to get the data

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,160
from the pages.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,090
But there is a concept called web scrapping where you can do it without relying on any front end automation

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,750
frameworks.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:06,120
OK, so basically the scrapping is used in researchers like if you want to get some on topic from the

16
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,310
Internet, so you have to resource that from the various websites.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,590
Right.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,360
So you can use the web scrapping concept to scan the data content from different Web applications and

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,840
get your data based upon your filters, what you apply.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,480
Right.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,430
So this is highly used in data science to extract the data based upon the logic, what you ask to get.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:41,160
And using that data, we analyze and prepare metrics like prepare pie charts, diagrams based upon what

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,670
we analyzed the data from VEP.

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,890
OK, so you know, one of the common principles, what we have in data science projects, it's like

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,320
find the data and play with it.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,000
So basically, when you want to analyze the data, like it could be like how frequently user is researching

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,430
something on the web or there is so much of data analyzing it.

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,750
So to analyze data first, we want to extracted from any Web application now, for example.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,220
So let me take you to the third IMDB.

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,480
You know, this is a famous website where you can find ratings reviews of many movies internationally.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,150
Right.

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,710
So now here you want to get all the movies list, which are part of Thriller.

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:37,130
So I would select TV episodes and get me all the movies with the word cult.

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,240
So all the pythons with me will be retrieved here.

35
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,490
So your goal is to get all the movie titles in your output.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:53,290
OK, you can scrap this page and get all the titles of movies into your output.

37
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,480
Once you get the data, you can do some research and you can get some analytics.

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,240
So that's where, you know, the scrapping comes into picture.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,410
So this subscribing help you to get data based upon your input so you can ask anything here and you

40
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,030
are scrapping, can pull the content from your webpage based upon what you provide and then you can

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,090
further use it for your research purposes.

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,220
So that is what one key principle, what we use in data science, is finding the data and playing with

43
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,810
it for any research.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:33,160
Finding data can be done with Python scrapping, which is one of the most common technique we use.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,990
And for that we use a utility called Beautiful Soap, which we going to discuss in this section.

46
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:40,960
Right.

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,710
And here we will not use any Front-End testing frameworks to do that.

48
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,800
That can be achieved on later note with the help of beautiful soap.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,340
So let's get started and see.

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,660
And that way you can understand more about scrapping when we do some practical examples.

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,440
So, as I said, you can do a number of filters here.

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,220
So our ultimate goal from the section is that, you know, you have to go to each and every movie here.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,180
So there are a lot of movies present on the.

54
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:19,840
So your goal is to scan each and every movie from this page and go to that specific movie and see what

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,790
is the gender of that comedy documentary or news or whatever.

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,180
So every movie have one gender, right?

57
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,840
So you should figure out what it is now, for example, if you see another link here, it is comedy

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,200
gener.

59
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,310
And here it is, crime fantasy, horror thriller.

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:50,420
OK, so like that, you have to get all the genders of each and every title displayed in this speech.

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,870
And the next lecture I will show you how to do that.

62
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,380
Using but scrapping with the help of beautiful soap.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,850
Thank you.
