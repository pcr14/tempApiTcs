1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,120
OK, so let's get started with installation of the hip, so I will point you to the official website

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,150
so that tomorrow, if something changed, you can just follow how I am doing and repeat the same process

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,740
to get the latest changes.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,130
OK, so once you have installed here, we did not install yet.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,170
So let's click on this and see what's going on.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:31,250
OK, so here they have clearly given instructions of how to download behave so you can take this comment

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,300
install.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,890
Get history dubious so you can go ahead and install it.

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,810
I already have in my mission, so I don't install this.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,400
So when you click and enter, you will get installed in your system.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,240
So behave.

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,580
OK, that is a step one.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:59,260
So once you install it, the next step is to have an ED to continue your framework, and you might wonder,

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,130
like, why would I need a ED?

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,620
Because I already have this fight on.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,800
But one problem with Paten is that it do not support really framework.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,370
OK, you don't support FITA fights.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,490
When I say fights and don't support, that means fight some community work and don't support.

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,220
There are two versions of it available in their website.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,140
One is community version, which is a free to download and another is a professional version.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:39,360
OK, so these guys have the ability, framework, support only for better uses for professional edition.

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,950
But don't worry, it's touchiness free trial is that we can still downloading this course and we can

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,640
do practice.

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,340
But after that ludus, it might ask you to provide latency.

25
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:58,390
OK, so the free version is not having support to create future files because future files is what we

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,360
are going to create.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,190
I just explained in the previous lecture.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,460
Right.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,850
So every test we describe in terms of Gurkin language by creating a feature file like this and when

30
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,590
you create a feature file, that extension, that of that file is DARD Fetim.

31
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,590
So till now, when we create any file here, the extension here is dart player.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:19,840
Right?

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:27,060
So that feature extension files are not supported in that community version of Biton.

34
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,460
So that's why I downloaded a professional version.

35
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,610
So you can see about Paten professional is there.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,140
So you can also get it.

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,100
I can picture.

38
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,540
How does that happen.

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,510
So I download.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,830
So we have to do this free version so you can still practice it and thereafter, if you are working

41
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,870
in any company, obviously they will provide if they have really a framework developed.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,020
So, yeah, you can see that free trial.

43
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,530
You can go ahead and download this for 30 days.

44
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,630
I think you can still extend also after 30 days for every 10 days, it will ask to extend.

45
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,630
So you can still continue in practice because I have this for more than a month and I'm still using

46
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,460
it happening somewhere it stuff.

47
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,380
But meanwhile, let's complete this.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,960
OK, so once you download and then you can open your project, you have already this project created.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,200
Right.

50
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,680
So fine, you can stay open and then you can choose that project which you already created and open

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,870
in your by some professional edition.

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:40,420
So once you open that, Ed, you are done with having a nice editor with you because only this election

53
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,360
is going to support plugins.

54
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,600
All right, guys, you have the hip installed with the installation of the camera on you and you have

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,220
additions as well.

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,690
Now, let's get started with our actual call.

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,350
So for this, I will create one folder under this package.

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,710
Right.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,250
So right, like new I would directory and directory, let's call it as a fetus.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,970
So that way I am creating project is very important because we expect you to follow some conventions.

61
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,290
So it checks for all the future files only in the fetus directory.

62
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,950
So you have to create a directory like this.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,770
So make sure you create one.

64
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:34,380
And under this fetus, let's create a new feature file new and scroll down and you will see Gurkin feature

65
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,650
five.

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,220
As I told you, this option will not be available if you try to use quite some community edition.

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,850
OK.

68
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,670
And let's say does.

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,860
Book AIPA is a feature film.

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,170
Right.

71
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,040
You see that pretty far in our data is already there here.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,410
So this is the syntax feature.

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,740
It's like you are best Sweetenham.

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,830
You can treat it as a test case because one feature will have multiple test cases.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,840
So better.

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,330
Let's have let's treat future as one test to sleep, OK?

77
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,250
At best, a suite which actually verifies and validates the book at a library.

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,220
OK, so you can say verify your books.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,570
Are anger and deleted

80
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,300
using library.

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,770
So this is our filter.

82
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,180
Mmm, something like this, a description now scenario is what you are actually a test case.

83
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,360
So let's say we have one test available here.

84
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,650
Right.

85
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,310
Let's dig this ad payload.

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,990
So here I'm not using beebee interaction.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,210
I'm using the interaction which we have created with this.

88
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,410
OK, so let's assume that we need to provide data from our file, not from the database.

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,310
OK, so we can drive this data from cucumber filter files instead of driving it from the files like

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,550
this.

91
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,340
I'll show you.

92
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,460
So I will pick this.

93
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,860
And what does this test against us?

94
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,140
So this will add a book and then it will immediately delete again and it is validating if book is successfully

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,640
deleted.

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,920
Right.

97
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,770
So this is what this test against us are and delete it immediately.

98
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,290
So this way we are relating to add and delete.

99
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,690
So let's start with an ebook here.

100
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,600
So I will describe a scenario like this.

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,650
But if I add Apria functionality, so this is my desk is.

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,700
So enter steps here and you can start by giving in given when then standard, I show you right.

103
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,180
How given Wendon standards.

104
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:09,470
Well, OK, so you have downloaded behav with install.

105
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,430
So make sure the compiler what you are community and professional edition have matches with that because

106
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,350
you downloaded it globally.

107
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,850
OK, so pippins done is done globally.

108
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:30,710
So that means you have to make sure the Python compiler, which is used globally, is also pointing

109
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,220
to this.

110
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,050
Ed.

111
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,490
OK, let's confirm that.

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,750
So fine settings and you can come to

113
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:50,660
Project Python interpreter and make sure you select the compiler, which it's globally there, because

114
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,420
there is the one you have installed usability.

115
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,660
Right?

116
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,760
So this is the one guy's user owner data programs Python.

117
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,420
This is a global python interpreter.

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,090
So when you download it from command prompt here where it will get installed.

119
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,250
So select this because this package have the information about him.

120
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,630
OK, so after you select, make sure that packet is displayed here.

121
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,640
This is the one behave is displaying.

122
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,100
It's all set up.

123
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,390
OK, right.

124
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,230
And he didn't enter from the scenario and you can start giving given so given what do we have?

125
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,610
We have the details right.

126
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:39,910
Given the details which needs to be added to the library.

127
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,930
OK, so we have the book details with us.

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,260
So what we need to do is then.

129
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,700
We execute that and ad book to Mr..

130
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,900
When we execute, I post ABC Post API method.

131
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,500
Then what happens when we do that?

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:12,010
Then it should be caps, then book is successfully added.

133
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,160
So this is what our scenario.

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,350
That's OK.

135
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,230
Success.

136
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,810
Perfect.

137
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,940
Now, this is really the standard scenario.

138
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,470
OK, here, when you read it tells the behavior of your test case, like given what you have, then

139
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,180
what do you perform and then what is the output you get?

140
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,770
OK, now for this, we have to plug in with our actual code.

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,810
So this is the worst scenario, which we return in future file.

142
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,190
And we we know that we're exactly what actual code is there.

143
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,430
And here in our actual code is present.

144
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,610
Now, in the next lecture, I will show how to plug in this code with each and every step here.

145
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,420
And from the integration between the code and your are Frankton interface of scenarios.

146
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,200
All right.

147
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,460
See in the next lecture.

148
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,390
Thank you.
