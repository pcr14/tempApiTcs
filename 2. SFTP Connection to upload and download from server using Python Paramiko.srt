1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,300
So once you are done with your work, make sure you close the connection with as Head Start, because

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,110
if not, multiple connections will be opened up and you will remember it will be filled, right.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:20,230
OK, next, we will try to see how to upload file from your local system to the server because we thought

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,700
of one project initially.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,910
Let's solve this project.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,640
I have one batch file.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,130
So this is the best file.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,740
Basically, this batch file will expect a copy file, which is also here.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,410
So this takes the CSP file and then update status of all the accounts displayed there, either approved

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,100
or rejected.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,870
So let me show you here first.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,370
So I'll save this.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,690
So this is the fight now.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,770
You can run this fine.

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:02,610
In your server, and that time when it runs, it expects this file also right as a CSP so that it updates.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,040
So basically these two files now should be in your Linux server.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,900
The reason why we need that in daylight in that server is when it tries to scan the profile details

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,450
of the account number and implement the logic.

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,320
All those should be accessed from database, but that database is not in your system.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,340
So far, this batch file to work correctly, this should be in the server database.

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,580
So as we are assuming that our databases are present in this Linux server.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,980
So let's actually move these two files from our local system to that.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:45,110
So just assume that you are a developer, gave you the banks file and asked you to run that broad database.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,190
So now your goal is to write a Python script that will take this batch file and deployed it along with

26
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,360
The Cafferty File and then run your batch file there to update us.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,150
Yes, OK, we'll see that.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,700
It's a fun.

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:06,870
So overall, you have to know how to upload files from your local system to Linux, so I copy these

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,410
two files.

31
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,950
I'll come back to my editor.

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,080
But I will create a new package.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,730
Or you can say directress, well, let's see how that actually comes back to face.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,020
So instead of this batch files, I copy those two files.

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,770
So.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
Copy.

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,290
And you can download the code by end of the section Greenberry.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,940
All right, so there are two files here.

39
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,710
One is a CSFI and there are no status yet because bad job elaborated.

40
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,360
Now, I will go back to my associate misconnect.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,190
And here, where I have to right now go to applaud these two files in the server, it's very easy,

42
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,310
I guess, for that.

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,920
There is another protocol which you have to use for uploading that is SFP.

44
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:23,300
OK, so that is another protocol available to upload or download the files, just like how SFH is used

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,440
to connect and that protocol will help you to upload or download.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,180
OK, so first you need to import that.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,810
However, with paramedical you will get it by default.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,830
So you have to open that SFP connection through your Secich.

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,830
I'll show you.

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:53,000
Upload files so we can accidentally open another connection, which will help you to transfer files,

51
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,230
vice versa.

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,690
OK, that can be done with this safety protocol.

53
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,510
And once you open that protocol, store it in one variable so that this object is now responsible to

54
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,120
transfer the files.

55
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,800
Now, where is the path you have to install it?

56
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,330
So let's say two parts.

57
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,800
One is the destination, but

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,750
the destination.

59
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:25,860
But as I told you, that by default, Python will have access to that home path of easy to happen user.

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,430
So an explicit here only.

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,180
Right.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,020
And what is the final?

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,830
So how would you need to pass it?

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,780
So this is our final script.

65
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,930
Not be a script.

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,530
Not.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,410
So basically, this fine will get stored in their destination, but as they are not giving any delay

68
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,240
little, but it will take place in the home.

69
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,500
But and from there you have to place that down.

70
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,340
So you need to give that the local pub.

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,210
I didn't get this sort of spot and it is present here.

72
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,850
So, again, the relative part copied and pasted here.

73
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,700
Great.

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,840
OK, so there is a simple matter now to send files, because this object is aware of such a connection

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,870
and also it open panel to send files, right, so that this object.

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:27,700
Dart put what is a matter which will help you to take the file from your local pot and it will place

77
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,960
it in the destination pot.

78
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,970
So basically this method expects to arguments one.

79
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,530
The first one is a local pot to pick the fight and the destination pot in places like.

80
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:53,390
So now, right now and a seven year, there is no final later with script be right now after running

81
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,110
this court, there should be a filed Lexi.

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,000
Perfect execution is done.

83
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,220
Now let's come back here and do a little funnier, and you'll see that script to be very fine.

84
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:19,380
So that means we have successfully more of our file from our local system to our line, except now you

85
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,850
need to just run this file.

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,450
But for this file needs to be filed as an input.

87
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:24,670
Right.

88
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,920
So that is also present in our local system.

89
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,550
So you need to push that as well.

90
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,210
Let me write another.

91
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:43,690
Three folders, you can create a method to wrap all this and simply pass a local bar, the destination

92
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,580
part as an input so that you can reuse that matter.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,650
OK, because we already discussed a number of examples of how to drive the usable components from configuration

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,150
files.

95
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,510
You see that in utilities.

96
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,760
We have already discussed so many files like this.

97
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,080
OK, so use similar way because there is no point in me showing storing that in separate glass because

98
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,050
we already discussed such kind of mechanism.

99
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,320
OK.

100
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,710
Is the search going to Daymo?

101
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,770
Is that fight here?

102
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,560
OK, I would now give one more part.

103
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,010
And destination file is the.

104
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,320
Take this as an assignment, OK, write this in separate utility file, upload file should be a method

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,330
and that should accept local port and destination port and it should do the work for you, OK, instead

106
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,550
of doing it here every day.

107
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,030
Loan Assir.

108
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,570
CSP.

109
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:56,800
Now we are pushing this file as well, so we destination is the same file and we are giving it from

110
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,010
our veterans.

111
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,290
OK, so now with this one, it will also push this file as well.

112
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,720
Let's see.

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,360
Great comeback back and you see that, yes, we find ourselves already.

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,870
So what is the next step?

115
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,520
So you have to preserve this batch file, as does a python file.

116
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,460
You can trigger with a command core python space copy.

117
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:23,630
Right.

118
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,200
OK, so all these files can be triggered with Python space filing.

119
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,790
So as we are using this python monitor, we are clicking as Ranaudo using controls.

120
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,590
But ultimately, if you want to execute all these files from command prompt the syntax is python space

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,250
and the file.

122
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:51,240
OK, and now we should execute this file so that this loan records will get the new status.

123
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,030
Now, if I see the cat, I will give Katamon to see what our contents are having CSFI.

124
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,700
Right now, status is blank.

125
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,190
OK, there is no status if the loan account is approved or rejected for this account.

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Now, when you've got a bad job, that bad job will update this CSFI with all the values.

127
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:18,150
OK, and that by double standards to go from this file only, let's not do it from anything from terminal.

128
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,700
We'll see that in our next letter, OK.

129
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,210
Meanwhile, try to write a reusable matter which will pick this upload file from configuration file.

130
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,500
OK, and you should also drive all this connection also from another configuration file.

131
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,370
So this way your car looks more clean, which we already did for database.

132
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,480
Just replicate.

133
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
Same for this section as well.

134
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,930
All right.

135
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,750
Thank you.
