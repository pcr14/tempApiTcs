1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:08,330
So in the last lecture, I have shown you how to spin up a rebellious Linux server and you need to do

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,240
a few more configurations to make this available for you to connect from your Python code.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,130
And let's see what all those.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,150
Not this one.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,530
Yeah.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,950
So firstly, it is by default, will not enable password authentication.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,180
Now, for example, we decided that we will soon connect from overpacked on to this server, which we

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,810
just created.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:44,490
In general, we will make hits collection from Python to your server so far.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,860
This is a search connection we need to give host.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:54,210
That means IP address of your server so that it will understand and username password.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,880
These are the details you have to send.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,870
But by default, NWS will not allow anyone to login with password authentication.

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,350
OK, that's default set to off.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,830
So as we are going to connect to that server with password, so we should make sure that we have to

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,350
enable it.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,810
So how to enable it?

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,000
So there are some set of comments which we need to run to enable the password in the server.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,230
Let's do that now.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,690
Right, so right now you are logged in as the easy to hyphen user because this is the user.

22
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,730
Now, there are two users in any other.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,950
One is the road user, just like in your Windows machine, you will have seen users and a bunch of names.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,210
Right.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,560
If you have two different accounts.

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,150
Similarly, Mirabilis, also by default, you will get one as a road user and another one is easy to

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,760
hyphen user.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,470
So by default, all configuration software installations you have to do as a rule user only, not as

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,640
easy to have one user.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,540
OK, so when you log in, you will be by default, easy to hyphen user now to log back as a road user.

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,290
This is the command.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,510
You have to give pseudo your hyphen.

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,320
OK, I have given the documentation so you need to blindly follow this documentation to make things

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,680
work.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,210
But again, please do not expect again my new details about all of this, because that's a whole different

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,690
story and it will be like another complete course.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,010
That is already one, though, of course, where I have explained all this clearly.

38
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,530
So this lecture is just for setting up again.

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,520
I repeat that in real time you will do all this work as automation engineer.

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,450
You will be given the server ready with all its assets, connections open.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,790
You just need to write a code to connect, which will be seen from later.

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,260
Just that you will practice with me, Baddeley.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm doing all this so that you can also have one set up and get some confidence.

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,240
OK, right, so you see that when you do like this, you will be now logged in as a road user.

45
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,330
So there is one file, as I suggested, configuration file.

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,350
You need to open that file and make a change to enable password authentication.

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:18,000
It will open like this and select a button, which means insert right after, insert more when you select

48
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,180
and then only it will be able to edit this file.

49
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,810
So scroll down and you should see password authentication.

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,090
Yeah.

51
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,440
Here, easy to use as keys for remote access.

52
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,140
So by default, password authentication is set to know.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,710
OK, so let's think it through.

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,200
Yes.

55
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,040
Right, so the password is said to us and now you can make a connection with username and password.

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,090
So once Americans click on Escape Button, then give column WQ.

57
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,620
So this is the command to step escape Collen WQ so that it file will be saved no good.

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,390
And next thing, what you have to do, you need to reload the service.

59
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,740
So you have made configuration changes, right.

60
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,020
You have to refresh your server with these changes.

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,010
So in Linux don't have to reload.

62
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,750
So service SAHD reload.

63
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,760
So this will reload and changes will be applied successfully.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,750
OK.

65
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,040
And next, you have to create a password for easy to hide from user.

66
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,780
I just told you that you need to connect to your Linux Servatius to make, as I said, the connection.

67
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,430
It needs username and password.

68
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,660
So you enable the password authentication.

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,200
But what is the password?

70
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,250
We don't know that.

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,290
OK, so by default, user name is created for you.

72
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,400
Easy to hyphen user when you create an instance, but for this user we should give password also.

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,900
But we should not try to login for the root username and password.

74
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,860
OK, we're not allowed to securely connect with the credentials user to create another user and then

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,970
connected to that server.

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,100
So by default, easy to hyphen user is the name which will be created.

77
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,400
So you just need to set a password for this game.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,870
OK, and to get a password.

79
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,800
This is the command versus WD.

80
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,670
You can simply write this.

81
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,670
Password, easy to have use user, and it will ask you to set new password.

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,030
Here I'm sitting easy to use only as password again one more time.

83
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,850
I made it round, I guess.

84
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,740
Yeah, plus did not match because I clicked on another button.

85
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,550
Perfect.

86
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,540
So when you give two times, then it will say ID tokens updated successfully.

87
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,800
So we are all set.

88
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,270
So basically these two are the details we need.

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,660
One is to create a password and then enable that from alias, which we did.

90
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,690
OK, so with this configuration, we are done.

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,960
So in the next lecture, let's start with Python court tools connect securely to the server and play

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
around with documents.

93
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,330
OK, thank you.
