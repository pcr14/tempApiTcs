1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome, guys.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,490
So in this section, I will show how we can make and I said connection to Linux, a server from your

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,270
local mission.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,390
OK, so assume that there is a batch job which is present in your server.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,780
This is different server.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:25,720
So from your local mission, you have to write the Python code, which should connect, establish connection

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:33,490
to that Linux server through its protocol and then execute the batches of present on that server from

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,020
your local python code.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,930
So this is one of the common scenario you will see in backend automation.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,230
So this will end.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,820
Python is heavily used to solve this problem in any project.

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:53,550
So in this section, we're going to see how to achieve and solve this problem with Python code, right.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,830
So far that we need Linux server.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,050
Right.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,660
So when we are making some connection to lambic server and running some bad job, so that means there

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,310
should be a Linux server for me to show and for you to practice.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,990
So I will be using A.W. Linux because that comes for free.

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,780
Parvenu, though it is free, you will have a minimal charges, which you have to know because if you

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,610
download or upload, it will give you some minimal charges.

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,740
So I request you to watch the video very next video about charges.

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,670
It would be around fifteen hundred to two thousand rupees in Indian currency and around for a dollar

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
in US dollar.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:42,190
So about that much cost, it will be incurred if you launch a new A.W., for instance, and solve this

24
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,330
entire assignment.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,620
Ballylee with me.

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,090
OK, so if you are okay to do that, so please go ahead, because for me there is no other solution.

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,300
So you will not have any server available for free to play around.

28
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,980
So L'Avenir something which is free, but this is about like data transfer.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,910
If you don't learn anything from Internet, that would take some minimal amount of.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,610
What it touches.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,850
So I would recommend you to watch the next video and see how to stop it after you complete your operations.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,110
That is very, very recommended for you to watch.

33
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,020
Next video on this subject.

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,350
If you are okay to pay this.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,340
If not, then just watch this video and have this concept in your memory so that you can use whenever

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,520
you get in your real time.

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,350
OK, so now I will show how to Forslund instance.

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,110
You need an account for that and then you can quickly launch it will go for it and then see about what

39
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,160
is the pricing before we actually start with all configurations.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,460
First, let's set up our line somewhere, OK?

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,570
Let's go to the official website management console.

42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,240
Now you can sign up and give all your details great and second, it might ask you credit card details

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,560
as well or debit card details you should provide them.

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,430
And once you provide and when you sign into your console, let me sign in.

45
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,050
So once you sign in, you will be landing on this page.

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,780
So these are the different services are provided by 11 years.

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,760
So we are interested in easy to service, so select services.

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,640
And here you can select AC2 and then you will be landing on this page.

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,180
Right.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,440
So these are running instances, dedicated host, you will see all these here so you can actually direct

51
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,130
launch in.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,300
So to get started launching Amazon, easy to instance, which has a virtual server.

53
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,620
This is what I am talking about.

54
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,440
And in our case, we are interested to have Linux virtual server.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,430
So just start with the launch in Stent's.

56
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,040
And this way, you will be shown multiple images available in Amazon cloud.

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,160
OK, so these are different operating systems you have and you can start your server with these operating

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,670
systems.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,520
You have Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, the lot of things here.

60
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,050
So here we just need this one, Amazon, Linux, because it have some inbuilt software assessment.

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,490
So let's use this 64 bit.

62
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:27,900
And there are different versions available, like based upon how much memory it should allocate to your

63
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,420
server.

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,490
So by default, only three dead is eligible for one version and you don't have any other option to just

65
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,030
choose that option and select next.

66
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,270
And these are a different network related configuration settings.

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,560
We are all to go with default settings because our goal here is to just practice as a demo and we are

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,350
not doing any networking to make it secure.

69
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,160
OK, so next and storage.

70
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,050
So you can add multiple stories like how much do you need, how much ram sized or how much size gigabytes

71
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,380
you need to store all your data.

72
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,290
So the default, whatever it's showing here, is self sufficient for us to work and play on with this

73
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,950
demo concept.

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,830
So just click on next, but not change any settings here.

75
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:20,680
Right.

76
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,590
So here you can give some tax.

77
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,590
You can see that you can define back with name and give value to that.

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,930
So basically name off your server so you can declare a name to a server.

79
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:43,080
So let's say Jenkins C8 server so that one can identify the next mission.

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,720
What we are using is nothing but Jenkins host.

81
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,930
So let us give some related name and that way we can easily identify our salani.

82
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,140
If you have fortified Linux servers running in your alias, you don't know really what is installed.

83
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,950
So you can have that name to your server, which will exactly relate to what that threat is doing.

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,560
OK.

85
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,260
Add the tag next.

86
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,640
Configure Security Group.

87
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,120
So here our goal is to launch Jenkins' on this server, right?

88
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,400
So Jenkins will be started on 884.

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,010
So by default, that port is not open.

90
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:32,660
So you have to clearly tell and a rule and stay open for a liati, then only 11 years will open that

91
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,370
port so that you can install them.

92
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,390
And it can be accessible from any other place.

93
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,890
OK, so you need to add that one security rule here and then you can launch it directly with review

94
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,960
and launch button.

95
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:54,680
OK, so you can just go with all default settings except that name value bid and adding one new rule

96
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,270
of starting and listening to a report of your own lunch.

97
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,970
And just see what I learned here.

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,320
Lunch.

99
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,640
Here you go.

100
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:16,230
So here it is for the first time, when you create any limits or when when you create any other server,

101
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,060
it will ask you to create one keep it bunfight.

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,150
What can we call it as dot B?

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,370
OK, this is a file which is used to authenticate.

104
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,580
So for the first time and you do this, you will not have keep it because I already have some sort of

105
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,170
in my account.

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,150
I have my keep it so you can actually create a new keepit.

107
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,810
Select this option and give keep your name.

108
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,120
And you said download that, keep it OK after that.

109
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,880
Any time when you want to come back and access the server again, everybody else will ask you to upload.

110
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,430
Keep it.

111
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,360
OK, now you create one and download right next time when you want to access it or when you want to

112
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,820
use that Linux server.

113
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,540
So you have to provide this keypad every time to authenticate you are safe.

114
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,300
Right.

115
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,260
So make sure you provide one proper name and download it and make sure you save it securely in your

116
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,130
system again, to access that server again for the next time.

117
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,260
You'll need this.

118
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,730
Keep it.

119
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,990
So for me, for the second, I already have an existing keeper, which is rather personal.

120
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,080
All right.

121
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,390
So I am selecting that and I acknowledge this and launch instances.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,350
And I said it will take a few seconds, two minutes, maybe in one or two minutes, you can see your

123
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,340
instances is running.

124
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,720
Select this link.

125
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,210
Following instances have been initiated.

126
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,630
So right now, instant state is spending, so it will soon come to running state.

127
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,780
So that means you are ready to use this server, but how to access the server?

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,690
Now, it's not easy to log in to the server because that is Nandy way more like Windows.

129
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,390
You will not see all that sort of thing.

130
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,500
Linux is all with command prompt.

131
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,680
OK, just do not assume that you will see another operating system where you have all these folders

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,790
and you navigate it just by the minute you will be able to access your new virtual machine only with

133
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,330
the terminal.

134
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,720
There is an option to have the UI as well.

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,700
That's a different story.

136
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,690
You need to have Ubuntu server and you need to install some more things but not required for us in general.

137
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,160
People will not use any way to access files, folders in Linux.

138
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,030
Everything will go in terminals with comments only.

139
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,120
OK, story is different.

140
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,780
It's not like Windows.

141
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,860
If you are a Mac user, it will be easy for you to grab this concept very fast because Mac also based

142
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,010
upon Linux distributionally.

143
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,280
So it's easy for you to catch up very speed with a comment waterwheels.

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:12,410
But don't worry, I try to teach all the comments from scratch so that no matter even if you are a Windows

145
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,810
user and never saw Linux before, you will be able to follow this course.

146
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:24,470
OK, I will try my best to give all those for you so that the patience is what I required from you initially.

147
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,600
You may feel everything is new.

148
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,440
That's obvious.

149
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,610
When you are learning something for the first time, you will feel like rocket science.

150
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,180
But slowly, when we are habituated with that, with much practice, we will feel like Lennix is more

151
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,040
easy than Windows Trustme.

152
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,510
OK, now to access your mission.

153
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,730
So there are different softwares to connect to.

154
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,700
To any Linux missions you have to connect through such glemp.

155
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,580
OK, so you have to make a hit.

156
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,700
Execution is what we call contessa's hit.

157
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,580
So you have to connect to your Atlantics missions to a secure shell.

158
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,100
Glemp All right.

159
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,100
And there are different softwares which we call us.

160
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,770
As I said, Scholem's one of them is Putti.

161
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,570
And there is another famous one, which is called Mobb Extoll.

162
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,250
I would recommend using this because these have lesser steps, then put it to connect and communicate

163
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,690
with the other Linux machines.

164
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,240
All these are associated Glenns.

165
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,000
OK, so you can Google very quick to see what this ASUS heads Klank and that will tell you that today

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,760
is one of that line and that will be used to connect to your line explanation's.

167
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,990
So, as I said, I will go with this option.

168
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,450
All right, so download.

169
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,820
And there are two versions, home and professional, we can stick to the home version, you can just

170
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
download this I already have in my system.

171
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,480
I guess so.

172
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,920
Home edition and.

173
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,390
Yeah, you can just go with whatever version you have, either portable audience that does not make

174
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,130
any difference.

175
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,320
So ultimately you should be able to install it and open that file in your system.

176
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:27,450
So it's in deep file and then extracted and you will see an option to open the door to actually file.

177
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:37,020
And this is how you see double click on the audio file, and that will take you to install this software

178
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,770
in our machines.

179
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,930
So once installed, you will see an app like this, you can just type and will be in your search and

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,490
you will see the app and double click on that app.

181
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,400
And after that you will see a screen, something like this.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,280
OK, and these are different how rearms which are already in use.

183
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,940
So once you open this.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,490
Select session, and that will take you to the speech and hear what is what type of session you are

185
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,760
using to connect to your next mission.

186
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,340
You have to do essays, Haertsch connection, OK, you see that secure special session.

187
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,820
You want to start with your excellent mission.

188
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,300
So select this option and then it will give this window remote host.

189
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,720
So here you have to provide IP address of your server.

190
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,560
OK, so we just started one instance right here.

191
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,450
If you come down, you will see an IP address to access your next server.

192
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:52,510
You can copy this and just paste here carefully without any spaces and specify username.

193
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,780
So this will be default.

194
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,560
Easy to hide.

195
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,170
Hyphen user.

196
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,700
OK, if you write any other user name here like your name of something, it will not work.

197
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:12,120
So user name by default will be easy to hyphen user for all alias Linux machines ok and select advanced

198
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,550
as hits settings.

199
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,000
Remember I told you that we need to.

200
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:27,310
Have Bumfights not Billiam extension, so that finally will help you to securely authenticate and will

201
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:35,550
help you to log into your online expression, so you have to select that and upload that thought Benki,

202
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,580
into your system.

203
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,420
Let's do that.

204
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,030
Yeah, I have my liberal partner just open it so that we weren't giving Darton fine.

205
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,330
So basically we were asking that let me I to get to this IP because this is my Linux server and to authenticate

206
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,500
this is my secret key, which will help you to unlock this mission.

207
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,040
Right.

208
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,480
And then click on OK.

209
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,080
And I think that will create you in your window like this, OK?

210
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,180
These two are existing windows in my mission.

211
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,030
Let me close them.

212
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,020
Right, this is another one, but when you open the first time, you will see something like this.

213
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,970
OK, so let me increase the font size.

214
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,330
OK, awesome, great.

215
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:31,690
So we have successfully connected to one Linux server throw at has hit glenoid and right now you are

216
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,630
in your Linux over.

217
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,490
As I said, don't expect any folders or any Douai items like Windows.

218
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,250
If you are first time watching this, there, of course, are watching Linux.

219
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,600
So you will be a little surprised to see is this the server?

220
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,830
Yes, this is how it looks and this is how you need to play around all the software downloads, everything

221
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,630
you will be doing to Comensoli.

222
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:07,670
All right, so in the next lecture, I will quickly go over pricing that how would you be charged this

223
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,200
amount and how you should stop the server at the end once you complete this project.

224
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,600
So that is very important.

225
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,720
Guys, please watch it.

226
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,750
And then we will continue with configurations to accept, as I said from the subsequent lecture.

227
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,770
Thank you.
