00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,830
Welcome, guys.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:10,440
So in this lecture, we will first see how to install my second in our system because we will be using

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,160
MySQL database to interact with the data present in database tables from our Python code.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,490
So to solve this assignment and project, we need MySQL database in our local system.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,580
OK, so in this lecture I will quickly show how to install it in your system so that from next lecture

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,670
we can start our proceedings to implement this project.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,150
Right.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,910
And just click down Glaube.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,020
My sequel In Stonham.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,780
Just Google search with my sequel installer, and then you will have their official link where you can

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,550
go and download here.

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:59,280
OK, so this is not MSA extension, which you can download anything worth, I guess, but this have

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,650
324 million downloads, so probably this could be the stable one.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,490
OK, so once you download, you will have in your machine the dart extension.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,090
You need to run that and then it will ask some questions.

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,710
Just click on next, next, next.

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,620
That will complete the installation of my sequel in your mission.

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,690
I have a screenshots.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,950
OK, so it might ask you to.

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,570
Select what type of account you need.

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,320
You can just go with a default account, what it's already selected.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,710
OK, because we need all the software developer default one.

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,600
And it will check if all the installations, what needed to download this are present in your system.

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,360
If not, it will try to solve all that for you.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,750
OK, and then after finally before that, there are some instructions.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,810
It will then it will take whether Python is present or not, it will install it.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,690
Just follow the instructions and click on next.

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,060
Thereafter, you will release configuration page where you will be asked to set a password, then set

29
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,900
any password.

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:17,420
And please remember it because you're going to use that in do our best to connect to our database through

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,290
Java code.

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,490
So desperate as the route so that you can remember.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,860
OK, that's OK.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,210
So and then after just click on your next and then you will see this, my sequel will be installed in

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,600
your mission after installation.

36
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,590
You can find it in program files.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,940
Let me show you that.

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,340
S..

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,620
Program funds.

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,710
And then here you will find my sequel's.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:57,870
Yeah, this one, but make sure that if you have any existing sequel instances, uninstall all of them

42
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,330
before you install this, my sequel.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,390
OK.

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,800
So if there are any existing sequels in your mission and then if you try to install my sequel on top

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,610
of it, you may see that workbench folder missing in my sequel folder.

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,730
That happens if there is already some server running in your mission.

47
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,490
Okay, go to program files and uninstall our control panel.

48
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,210
You'll have an option where you can uninstall the programs from there and install all existing and then

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,180
try to install a freshly so that we will have this workbench.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,000
If you already have my zip code in your mission with this setup, then you can skip this installation.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:48,800
You can click onto this workbench further and start this or my sequel file so that it gets open.

52
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:58,200
Basically, this is an editor where you will write sequel queries either to insert the records in database

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,410
or retrieve them or to perform any sequel operations.

54
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,880
You have a neat editor inform of the workbench.

55
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,860
OK, so when you connect for the first time, it might ask you that credentials, your username is root

56
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,160
and password is whatever you give there, if you give them password, also will be rude and see that

57
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,640
this sequel is started.

58
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,960
Sarut started on three three zero six support in your mission.

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,980
OK, if there is any other project started, just not on the sport, no one will be using that later,

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,550
OK.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,780
So simply select this and that will ask you the password.

62
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,990
Give the password and that's it.

63
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,190
Just click on OK, and then you will be taken to the workbench.

64
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,680
