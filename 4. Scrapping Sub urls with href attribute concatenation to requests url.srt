1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:11,380
OK, so I will go back to the webpage, and our next goal now is to open each and every TV episode here

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,800
and then see what type of ginner it is.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,430
So that is our next goal.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,440
So right now we just scrambling and give the guidance only let's move further.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:31,390
So you have to go to the next debate and find out the gender, but how to go to the next debate, that's

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,130
tricky, right?

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,980
So how to do that?

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,690
Let's see.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,140
These are all different tools available here.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,480
Right.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,430
So in the last lecture, we just understood that we can grab the content with the help of text method.

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,760
We also understood that you can apply find a method on your soap object to find and narrow down your

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,750
Hesterman results.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,080
And when you apply, find all that will give all the matching results back.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,210
These are the three methods we learned now.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,360
So.

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,750
Your next goal is to reach the spit, go into this space, but we don't know how to navigate to that

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,960
page, right, because the link is not displayed anywhere here.

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,330
So how to get that link?

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:24,270
If you're smartly absol on the Antaria, you apply DOT text so that it gives the title.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,780
But there is another attribute called Hedstrom.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,360
So this attribute is nothing but a link to that child page.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,340
Now you are on this page.

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,380
So to navigate to another page, you see that whatever you have here titled three seven one three three,

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,230
everything is here.

26
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,130
So that's a basic right.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
So how to navigate to this specific title?

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,030
Suffit that link is displayed here.

29
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,010
So we should write some logic.

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:07,380
That we have to extract this order and then concatenated with I am the dot com, slash this head through

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:15,910
that logic here is like you copy this completely Babycham the dot com slash and pasted here so that

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,640
you will go to that child a bit of this movie.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,460
So this way we can get you on it because you are is most important for us that you are alonely.

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,330
We will do this request also that we get the hestia content.

35
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,010
And from that historical content we have played beautiful stock to access Hesterman.

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,820
So that way we will scan again this entire page and then reach the genders to figure out what is present

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,140
here.

38
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,590
So to scan this child web pages for each and every title, first we need to know you are and then only

39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,120
you can do.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,250
And we have a clue here how to get a you are on a headset in fact.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,320
Right.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,530
So now let's try to construct a child a you with the help of this.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,020
It's simple, guys.

44
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,190
Now, you are on this anchor, right?

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,490
So this frontal lobe actually lands, and every time when it runs, you will land on this anchor.

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,730
You earlier you used to get vital, but now you need this attribute value.

47
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:32,860
So to get attribute value so you can use the square bracket and give that attribute value that's up.

48
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,530
So when you apply this automatically, you will control.

49
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,890
Well, first of all, rich there.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,420
OK, and then it will see what is written in square brackets.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,130
If you say it's ref and the total value.

52
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:53,480
Will be extracted, so let's store it in the one variable again, Saburo.

53
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,260
So now this new order will help us to navigate to the next debate, right.

54
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,110
OK, once you get a subdural, let's do one thing.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,670
Again, I will use this request to get.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,630
Plus.

57
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:24,920
Start a game, so you have to start with I am David Dotcom, this is the bed and you are right on this

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,750
parent you are in.

59
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,370
Not required because that slashes is already coming from here tided.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,650
We will concatenate with this sub.

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:45,560
All right, so that this all will be hit and the quest will make a call to that and we will create the

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,930
end of the object like this sub data.

63
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,130
So this is this now holds a title page of your title.

64
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,680
OK, so this title Childbed is now stored here.

65
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,700
Once you start here, you know that you can apply a beautiful silk method to convert that into SoPE

66
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,180
object.

67
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,550
You can again use a same beautiful soap method instead of data.

68
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,020
This time we are grabbing some data, not content investment.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,400
And you can say any child soap.

70
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,570
Awesome, looks interesting, right, and now you have the content of this page, Aspen, so your goal

71
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,630
is to get this generate.

72
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,280
So let's try to inspect the system and object.

73
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,180
Comedy, OK, so basically this general value is here.

74
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,390
So this is the class C more in line can rap.

75
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,100
And from this glass, we will actually drill down to this and create that one thing, the same strategy,

76
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,440
guys, what we have done earlier, you have child support right now.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,290
Let's find child support find.

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,900
And first, let's give the tag name Cardell because find my daughter will accept Tognum.

79
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,760
But if you use only this, there are so many depths, so you can't find this uniquely.

80
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,870
So that's why we will use a called classic wants to see more in Canberra because that is where this

81
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,490
general is wrapped.

82
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,980
So to give any attribute, you have to use mapping here.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,390
So.

84
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,980
Glass.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,780
Colin, and what is that copy be the name.

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,360
So this is where you are getting the general value.

87
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,620
OK, what next?

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,790
But this will not help you, you are not exactly on that committee, right?

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,270
So you are just on the main title.

90
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,970
So now to drill down your reasons to anchor.

91
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,520
So let's say you just need faster, General.

92
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,820
Let's not pull up.

93
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,500
Everything will become the first one.

94
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,990
So your next goal.

95
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,050
Jenner on this drill results.

96
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,650
OK, now we drill results and now you're soap control is only under this package.

97
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,340
When you use Jenner now it will start only inside because we narrowed down our results in that Jenner

98
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,950
dart find.

99
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,570
So it will search only inside that.

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,810
So what should be fine now?

101
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,840
A anchalee, so there are only two tanks here, right?

102
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,440
So instead of trying to drill down your results, Father, I can use Dorottya directly and this will

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,760
help you to go to that DIAGNE just like how we have gone here.

104
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:14,310
Once you found your results from that result, you are drilling down your results to Anchorage.

105
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,660
So don't give that tag name, so you will reach.

106
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,900
OK, if one or two tanks are present.

107
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,620
You can do that.

108
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,950
And once you reach here, what you should do, you should extract the content, how to extract the content,

109
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,060
not the text that we already did that text.

110
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,490
OK, and to see that output in the output can print.

111
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,400
All right, so what happens now?

112
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,770
What this court is actually doing, let's try to understand.

113
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:54,700
So here all the rules are grabbed of this in this variable, and we are using one furlough so that every

114
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,470
time one rule will be picked.

115
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:05,800
On that road, you are actually going and getting that title and you are printing it, and next you

116
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:14,830
are also taking that separates you are from that place and you are constructing a new are to navigate

117
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,320
to that page as well from Main Page and some you are and you are making a request also that you will

118
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,870
get soap object again.

119
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:22,710
Right.

120
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,360
So this is how you create a soap object for this child.

121
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,940
Guess once a great soap object and then you are dealing down your results to exactly.

122
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,930
Come to this, Jennifer.

123
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,740
So once you reach here, your actual value is present in Anchorage.

124
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,720
So you are moving there with a dart and once you are there, you are calling text method to extract

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,480
the content.

126
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,990
So this will repeat for you each and every story here.

127
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,470
So here also it will go to the next page.

128
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,240
And for all that TV episode titles, it will go to each and every page now.

129
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,890
And it will give you the.

130
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,730
That specific Jenette, or whatever you have, you see that how easy it is to scrap it.

131
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,820
If someone asked you that, I'm sorry, there could be some positive results on this base right now

132
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,930
showing two hundred only.

133
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,630
You've done a thousand movies displaying here.

134
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,690
And if you want to know what is the gender of each and every movie, that you can only get that by going

135
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,270
to that base and figuring it out.

136
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,720
But now, with the simple script, you need not go to thousand pages.

137
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,770
Even if you use any selenium frontin framework's to get that title, you have to go to that page and

138
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,710
again grab it and then come back.

139
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,030
So here no more browser browser itself will not invoke and not transferral pages.

140
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,230
Simple code.

141
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,470
This code will help you to scan some pages also of all these pages and will give you the content.

142
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,150
So it's cool, right.

143
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,650
That's where web scrapping comes into picture.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,920
So if your goal is only to extract content from various pages, I would recommend using this web scrapping

145
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,380
instead of any fronton frameworks.

146
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,980
So let me run this.

147
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,380
And see, what are the results of a millgate control shift aften.

148
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:16,450
OK, so OK, first of all, this thriller, it's a comedy and next movie, also thriller drama, and

149
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:24,300
you'll see that crime framed music so fast it is showing the title because we are first printing printed

150
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,010
title and we are printing generalities.

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,900
So it is successfully going to the also and grabbing it.

152
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,360
So this way you can grab the data.

153
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,260
So in data science projects, people use all these concepts to get the data from multiple pages and

154
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,830
they prepared our data analytics.

155
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,590
OK, so it failed here.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,010
There is a reason which I talk in the next lecture.

157
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,310
So we actually started working and we are seeing some results out here.

158
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,200
So let's continue and see what's going wrong here.

159
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,020
There is one technique you have to use, which I say next lecture.

160
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,050
Thank you.
